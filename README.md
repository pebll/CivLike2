# CivLike

This Unity project was intended to create the basis for a Civilization like game (i really like 4X and really want to create my own at some point)

## Map generation
The progress until now is a map generation using noise maps, a resource system, and a shy beginning of a building system.
The mapge is pretty cool since you can control 4 parameters to drastically change the generation:
- elevation
- humidity (water level)
- temperature
- vegetation
